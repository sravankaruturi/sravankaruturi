### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is <b>Sravan Karuturi</b>

I work at StriVR as a Software Engineer. 

My recent projects here include upgrading Unity for our project and working to make a Vision Pro application.

You can find more about my past work here: http://sravankaruturi.github.io/

My personal projects are primarily in C++/C#/Java working on Game Engines and Graphics. You can take a look at some of them in the pinned repos. ( Banana engine )

I recently started a Swift project, a To Do and productivity app called Cortex.

I'm also learned React/NextJs ( and React Native ) and my first major project is my portfolio found at ( www.sravan.gg ) and the source code for that is the react-portfolio repo.

My other interests include, VR, AI/ML and learning new languages, both programming and natural ( currently French and TypeScript ).

I'm looking for new oppurtunities so if you have any that you think I'd be a good fit for, please reach out!
