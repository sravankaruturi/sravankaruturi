### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is <b>Sravan Karuturi</b>

I'm a Senior Systems Engineer working for Osmo/Byjus.

My work primarily consists of maintaining a systems layer on top of the Unity Game Engine and writing new modules for that layer. 

You can find more about it here: http://sravankaruturi.github.io/

My personal projects are all in C++ working on Game Engines and Graphics. You can take a look at some of them in the pinned repos. ( Banana engine )

I'm also learning React/NextJs ( and React Native ) and my first major project is my portfolio found at ( www.sravan.gg ) and the source code for that is the react-portfolio repo.

My other interests include, VR, AI/ML and learning new languages ( currently French ).

I'm looking for new oppurtunities so if you have any that you think I'd be a good fit for, please reach out!
