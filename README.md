### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My Name is <b>Sravan Karuturi</b>

I work at Strivr as a Software Engineer. 

My recent project at work is developing an application for the Apple Vision Pro to deliver 3D immersive Learning for a major bank. I wrote two versions of the app, one in Swift for the first 6 months, and one in Unity + Swift for the last 3 months. 

You can find more about my past work here: http://sravankaruturi.github.io/

My personal projects are primarily in C++/C#/Java working on Game Engines and Graphics. You can take a look at some of them in the pinned repos. ( Banana engine )

I recently started a Swift project, a To Do and productivity app called Cortex.

I'm also learning React/NextJs and my first major project is my portfolio found at ( www.sravan.gg ) and the source code for that is the react-portfolio repo.

My other interests include, VR, AI/ML and learning new languages, both programming and natural ( currently French and Swift ).

I'm looking for new oppurtunities so if you have any that you think I'd be a good fit for, please reach out!
